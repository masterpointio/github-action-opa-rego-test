## üöÄ Usage
It's super easy to get started and use this GitHub Action to test your OPA Rego policies. In your repository/directory with the `.rego` files and the `_test.rego` files, simply checkout the repository and add the step with `uses: masterpointio/github-action-opa-rego-test@main`. It's as simple as adding the step with no required inputs!
```yaml

## üèóÔ∏è Setup & Run Locally
You can use [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to simulate and run a GitHub Actions workflow locally. To directly test the custom TypeScript action locally, you can:
1. `npm run install`
2. `node ./dist/index.js`
This is assuming you have `npm` and `node` installed already. Note: You will have to manually provide the required inputs since this is directly executing the TypeScript code.

## üì¶ Releases / Packaging for Distribution
We use [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to easily compile this TypeScript Node.js module into a single file together with all its dependencies, gcc-style, to package it up for use and distribute.

To use, simply run the command (see the source in `package.json`):
```bash
npm run build
```

To create a new release... TODO, release please with `npm run build` and commit to /dist distribution
